**Tutorial**

Download via:

	git clone https://github.com/ConchoPecan/ReportMod.git <Local Path>

The easiest way to get started is to cd on over to the parent folder of ReportMod.py. This requirements opening up either command prompt or Terminal. We will assume for this tutorial that we're using Windows (I know, Linux users get no respect, but you're in my heart and I feel your pain). For example, let's assume we are using a local NW3C user account and we downloaded the this repo to a special git folder (We'll be on Windows):

	cd C:\Users\NW3C\Documents\git\ReportMod

If you are unsure you're in the right folder, use dir (or ls) and if you see **ReportMod.py** listed, you're in the right place.
